# DSHub tutorials
Welcome to the area for Cognite Jupyter Notebook tutorials. Here you can find tutorials you can use to learn how to interact with, and build value on top of CDF. 

As a starter, we recommend to start with the [workshop](./workshop). This workshop contains multiple tutorials that start with the basics, and transforms you into an advanced user of CDF to unleash the full power of what we deliver.
